# scanpy_geniomhe
Python Bioinformatics code for single-cell omics data analysis

## Goal

The goal of this modification of scanpy is to allow some *dynamic plots* in order to have more information, and to generate a *QC report* to give a summary of the results after the different important preprocessing steps.

## Instructions/use

### Installation

To use our library, you have to import our git. Our functions are in the folder `oopsc`.

First, you have to install dependencies, like this :

```bash
git clone git@github:StephanieFouteau/geniomhe_OOP_project.git oopsc
cd oopsc
pip install -e .
```

### Use
